This Project repository involves Proteus V8 simulation schematic file and PCB pdf file  

This project showcases a reliable and efficient automatic lighting system that activates in low-light conditions. The system uses key electronic components such as an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), operational amplifier (LM358), TIP122 Darlington transistor, and LM7805 voltage regulator to create a light-sensitive switching mechanism.

By detecting ambient light levels, the system autonomously triggers an output relay to power an external LED load. The use of an op-amp comparator allows fine-tuning of the darkness threshold, offering greater control and customization. TIP122 ensures robust current handling for switching, while LM7805 provides regulated 5V output for the control circuitry.

The entire design is developed and tested in Proteus simulation software, followed by PCB layout and hardware implementation using a traditional etching method. This project is ideal for low-power automation, street lighting systems, and smart energy solutions.
